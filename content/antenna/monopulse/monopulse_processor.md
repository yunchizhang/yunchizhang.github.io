[TOC]

Two-coordinate monopulse normally requires three receiver channels. However, systems that require
only two channels or a single channel are also reported in the technical literature.

## Single-Channel Processor

One approach to minimizing receiver complexity and lack of accurate gain and phase tracking among
the three receiver channels is to combine the sum and difference signals, either at RF or after
conversion to IF. Therefore, a single-channel receiver system is sufficient.
