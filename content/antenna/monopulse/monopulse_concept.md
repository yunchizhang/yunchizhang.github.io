# Basic Concept

Monopulse technology using four feed horns or dipoles are discussed in this page to illustrate the basic
concept.

## Mechanical Design

A paraboloid-reflector antenna fed by a cluster of four feed horns in the focal plane.

*Reflector and feed horns: (a) side view; and (b) axial view of feed horns from reflector*

## Amplitude Comparison Monopulse

The squinted beams received by the feed horns are illustrated below.

### Equation

The Sum and the differences are given by the following equations.

- Sum: $s=\frac{1}{2}(A+B+C+D)$

- Traverse Difference: $d_{tr}=\frac{1}{2}[(C+D)-(A+B)]$

- Elevation Difference: $d_{el}=\frac{1}{2}[(A+C)-(B+D)]$

### Voltage Pattern

The voltage patterns $v_1$  and $v_2$  of the pairs of squinted beams are:

- Traverse:

$$\begin{cases}v_1=\frac{C+D}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \\ v_2=\frac{A+B}{\sqrt{2}} \end{cases}$$

- Elevation:

$$\begin{cases}v_1=\frac{A+C}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \\ v_2=\frac{B+D}{\sqrt{2}} \end{cases}$$
