I work in the field of telecommunications, specializing in Antenna Design, RF System Design,
Digital Communications, Digital Signal Processing, and Software Development. My professional
experience includes designing and testing Earth ground station antenna systems, developing RF and
microwave components, conducting RF system analysis and simulations, performing modem validation
and verification testing, and building digital communication system simulations. With a solid
background in software development, I contribute effectively to both the hardware and software
aspects of telecommunications projects.

I hold a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, where I
gained a strong foundation in communication technologies as well as RF and microwave component and
system design.

I am proficient in a wide range of computer-aided engineering tools, including:

* Digital Communications: [MATLAB/Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/), [Keysight
  SystemVue](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/products/software/pathwave-design-software.html), [GNU
  Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* Satellite Communications: [AGI STK](https://www.agi.com/)
* RF/Microwave Design: [Ansys HFSS](https://www.ansys.com/products/electronics/ansys-hfss), [CST
  Studio Suite](https://www.3ds.com/products/simulia/cst-studio-suite),
  [GRASP](https://www.ticra.com/software/grasp/), [Keysight
  ADS](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/products/software/pathwave-design-software.html), [Mician
  µWave Wizard](https://www.mician.com/)

Outside of work, I have a strong interest in web and software application development. I am
experienced in several programming languages, including Python, C++, MATLAB, VBA, JavaScript, HTML,
and CSS. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, playing pickleball, and watching sports. Whether I’m
working on cutting-edge telecommunications technology or exploring personal projects, I’m always
eager to find innovative solutions and stay current with the latest industry trends.

# Notes and Posts

I write posts about the small challenges I encounter and solve, so I can refer back to them in the
future.

I also create technical notes, articles, and tutorials on topics that interest me, as a way to
deepen my own understanding.

These notes and posts may also be helpful to others who come across them while searching the web
