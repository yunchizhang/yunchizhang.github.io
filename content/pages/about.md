My name is Yunchi Zhang. I work in the field of telecommunications, specializing in Antenna Design, RF system design, Digital Communications, Digital Signal Processing and Software Development. My professional experience includes designing and testing Earth ground station antennas, developing RF/Microwave Components, conducting RF system analysis and simulations, performing modem validation and verification testing, and developing digital communication system simulations in Matlab/Simulink. I also have a background in software development, enabling me to contribute to both hardware and software aspects of telecommunications projects.

I hold a Ph.D Degree in Electrical Engineering from University of Maryland at College Park, where I gained a strong foundation in communications technology and RF/Microwave component and system design.

Outside of work, I have a keen interest in web and computer application development. I am experienced in a few programming languages: Python, C++, Matlab, VBA, Javascript, HTML, CSS. I enjoy hiking, playing pickle ball, and watching sports games in my free time. Whether working on cutting-edge telecommunications technology or pursuing personal projects, Iâ€™m always eager to explore innovative solutions and stay updated on the latest industry trends.
